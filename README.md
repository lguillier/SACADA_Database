Database for SARS-CoV-2 and coronaviruses inactivation kinetics on surfaces and in liquid media

The aim of this repository is to present a database of SARS-CoV-2 and coronaviruses inactivation kinetics on surfaces and in suspensions.

The codes provided makes it possible to reproduce the approach and figures of the article submitted to Scientific Data.

This repository is part of the Data Managment Plan of ANR SACADA.

## Funding
This research was funded by the French Research National Agency (ANR) in the framework of the SACADA Project (ANR-21-CO13-0001).
